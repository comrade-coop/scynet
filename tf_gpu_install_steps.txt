First, install CUDA (runfile), following these instructions: http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux

Don't forget to read and do all post-install sections (http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#post-installation-actions)!!!

Install CUDNN, by downloading the .tgz archive and copying the files as defined here: http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html

You'll likely need to compile tensorflow manually to make sure that the Cuda/CUDNN versions match. Follow here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux (only ignore the install of cuda-command-line-tools, they are already installed)

Install TF build dependencies, build and enjoy (keep in mind to build for pyhton3, not python!)
